# Greetings, my dear fellow 🖐️
Happy to have you join me on this little page I call ~my propaganda centre~ home! Here are some unsollicited factoids about me :D
- I’m a university student from Toronto, Canada. 
- I love the planet and my mother! 💖
- **I value helpfulness, reliability, and resourcefulness (in that order).** 
- **I’m looking for ways to solve neglected global problems.** 🌎👔

# About the whole code thing... 👉👈
I’ll be honest - I’m not the best senior-executive-commander-supreme-lead-developer-in-charge-person :D

Don’t get me wrong - one of my core values is resourcefulness, so **there’s very little I can’t learn within 3 days and 10 Stack Overflow posts** 😸
But I don’t code for the sake of coding. It’s a tool for me - like a screwdriver. 
- I don’t think: “YEAH, I LOVE TURNING THIS SCREWDRIVER!!!” 😜
- I think: “Wow, look at this cool problem I can solve with a screwdriver!” 

These days, **I’m working on web apps, cross-platform mobile apps, CAD designs,and AI algorithms.** Here are some recent projects:
- [Bestie Mail](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/bestie-mail): I made this site with React to send a funny, cute message to your special someone. 
- [Personal Website](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/Madhav-Malhotra.github.io): Site made with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and Notion Sites. Showcases my portfolio, blog, and some hidden goodies 😉
- [Sprint Timer](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/sprint-timer-app): My first app, made with React Native. It’s meant to be simple - set a time, set a goal, and work. 
- [Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/Madhav-Malhotra/neural-style-transfer): I learned about neural style transfer in Andrew Ng’s CNN course. I then used it to make my best friend a photo gallery because she loves nostalgic photos 🤗
